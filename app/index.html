							<span class='section-title'>Our Story</span>
							<p>It all began with a hat. Patrick and Hannah first met at a GWU Greek mixer in the winter of 2009. He was from the University of Maryland, and she was from the University of Virginia. Hannah was skeptical and unimpressed by Patrick, but intrigued. After the party, Hannah requested to take Patrick's hat. Although their initial meeting was unremarkable, they always kept in touch, until Patrick decided to retrieve his hat back from UVA. </p>
							<p>
								From there, Hannah and Patrick became inseparable. Even the blizzard of 2010 couldn't keep them apart. From College Park to Charlottesville, from North Potomac to West Chester and Virginia Beach they would always visit each other at every opportunity. Whether it was stay at home TV/Movie night, a trip downtown, or a vacation abroad, Hannah and Patrick always enjoyed each others company.

							After dating for almost seven years, Patrick popped the question on the last day of their vacation in Rome, Florence, and Venice. Patrick originally planned to propose on a gondola along the beautiful canals of Venice. However, Hannah booked an atypical excursion where they learned how to row the gondola instead. Hannah had difficulty rowing the gondola and was left frustrated, so Patrick decided not to propose at that time.
							</p>
						<p>
							Luckily, Hannah wanted to visit the San Giorgio Maggiore bell tower to see the sunset. The bell tower overlooked all of Venice and the sky was absolutely stunning! As the sun set and the crowd started thinning out, Patrick got down on one knee and asked the question!

							<h3>Erin Doody</h3>
							<p>I met Hannah about 15 years ago, and we've somehow nurtured a lifelong friendship. I credit Hannah's incredible tenacity and candor. Although it feels like yesterday we were just a group of goofy teenagers, we've traveled, danced, and laughed our way through the years. I'm so excited for your next journey!
							</p>
						</div>

							<h3>Linh Ly</h3>
							<p>Hannah and I met at the beginning of our first year at UVA when we were going to our very first
							college party and have been close friends ever since then. Our friendship has grown over the past 11
							years from traveling, eating out, studying, giving each other advice, and sharing new experiences like
							taking improv classes. Hannah is one of my favorite travel buddies and we have had quite a few
							adventures together in New York, Puerto Rico, Las Vegas, and Miami. One of the funniest moments from
							our trips was the time we were at a beach in Puerto Rico trying to get free ice cream, but ended up
							being selected for a hula hooping contest hosted by a local radio station. We had a lot of laughs from
							the randomness of hula hooping to Danza Kuduro at the beach when we just wanted ice cream. These
							amusing and unforgettable experiences just seem to happen whenever we get together regardless of
							where we are.
							</p>
							<p>
							I am very excited to be a part of Hannah and Patrick's special day. I remember when Hannah
							and Patrick started dating and Hannah told me that Patrick was super nice and not like the other guys
							she dated in the past. Hannah and Patrick have a rather unique dynamic that is always entertaining to
							witness. They complement each other so well and I look forward to spending more time with them as a
							married couple.

							<h3>Jenny Lyn Espiritu</h3>
							<p>We've been friends since high school, bonding first over FBLA and Calculus matters, and eventually becoming closer with insightful talks on relationships and colleges and careers. Despite some distance and time apart, we've maintained a friendship that's truly caring and comfortable, getting together to talk, and eat, and color. And despite her child like voice and height, she's taught me a lot, giving me perspective and kind advice on work-life balance and family. I'm so honored to be her bridesmaid.
							</p>
							</div>
						<div id='katie-bio'>
							<h3>Kate Hamby</h3>
							<p>Hannah and I met in freshman year of high school; we bonded over CosmoGirl and TeenVogue magazines in study hall. For the next few years we spent just about every weekend together, window shopping at the mall and eating copious amount of fast food! We've remained close over the last 15 years despite our different area codes, chatting on the phone when we have a few spare minutes and catching up over drinks when she comes into town. Hannah is nonjudgmental and supportive, but also the type of friend you can always count on for the unabashed truth. I've loved growing alongside of her all of these years, and I am so excited to be a part of her wedding day!
							</p>

							<h3>Olivia Sawyer</h3>
							<p>
							Hannah and I met our freshman year of high school. Hannah, Katie, Erin and I formed an unlikely foursome, passing notes during the day and passing hours on the phone at night. At first, I thought Hannah was quiet, but as i got to know her, I found that we had plenty to talk about. Both of us had (annoying) big brothers, hard-working immigrant moms, and similar goals and dreams.  We liked DIY crafts, yummy food, bargain shopping, and just spending time together — and still love these same things 15 years later. Whether we are down the hall, down the street or across the country, we will always be there for each other.

							<p>
							'There is no better friend than a sister, and there is no better sister than you.' Hannah is my sorority little sister and I am so grateful that we have been there for each other since we first met at UVA. In college, we bonded over midnight funnel cake making and countless hours trying to figure out life :) Over the years, we have navigated through different stages of life and continued to create many fond memories together. I am very excited to be part of Hannah's bridal party especially because it may include helping her pick out the best cake!

						<div id='donna-bio'>
						  <h3>Donna Siu</h3>
						  <p>Patrick and I go way back, circa sophomore year of high school. Science was never my forte and I was in desperate need of Chemistry tutoring.  Sure enough, Patrick was there to save the day! Being neighbors at College Park, we'd chat about our lives, dreams and aspirations. I still remember the day Patrick started gushing about this awesome lady he met (our Hannah!) and the rest was history. Now that Patrick and Hannah moved to the SF Bay Area, we find ourselves once again neighbors and I'm just thrilled that these two are finally tying the knot! Lets get the party started!!</p>
						</div>
						<div id='nuri-bio'>
						  <h3>Nuri Cha</h3>
						  <p>I met Hannah in our first year of college. Our dorm rooms were next door to each other, but we didn’t get close until the spring semester when we joined the same sorority. After getting to know Hannah, I gained a friend I could depend on, speak honestly with, trust, and stumble through the ups and downs of college with. I would not have made it through college without our late night vent sessions and her encouragement to embrace new opportunities.</p>
						  <p> When Hannah met Pat, I could tell immediately that their relationship was different, that their relationship would last. I’ve seen their relationship grow and could not be more excited for their upcoming wedding. Congratulations, Hannah and Pat!</p>

						  <h3>Aaron Sampliner</h3>
							<p>
							  Patrick and I met in middle school years and years ago. We were fast friends and always would play games together, we were the best 2v2 team around! We even share the same interest in cars. We've kept in touch since we were kids, even though we've both moved away from home. I cannot wait for your celebration and I'm really excited for you and Hannah!

						  <h3>Best Man</h3>
						  <p>I am very excited for Patrick and Hannah's wedding next year. It brings me great pleasure to be Patrick's best man. One of the most striking things about Patrick is that he's always a very reliable person. Even though him and I have an almost eight year age gap, I can always seek help from him whenever needed. From teaching me how to utilize computer software to my schoolwork, Patrick has always been there.</p>
						  <p>He's one of the most honest and moral persons that I know to this day. One of the most important thing's that I have learned from Patrick is the importance of family and what it means to cherish time with loved ones. Patrick and Hannah's bond is very admirable and I hope that their wedding will be amazing. </p>

					    <div id='charles-bio'>
						  <h3>Charles Chiang</h3>
						  <p>Charles and Patrick met freshman year of college. One of the most memorable quotes Charles remembers about Patrick was at the campus diner where Patrick picked the ugliest piece of pie and he said "the messier it is, the better it tastes." Charles knew that they would get along perfectly.  Their love for DOTA and cars brought them further together, and resulted in a close bond that not even living on opposite sides of the US can break.</p>
					    </div>
					    <div id='ritchie-bio'>
					    	<h3>Ritchie Kwan</h3>
					    	<p>
					    		I met Patrick in college as a suitemate in Washington Hall. He introduced me to DoTA. Anyone who has played DoTA knows there is no better bonding experience than raging together while playing DoTA. Our friendship was defined by late night gaming, working out, partying, and putting all our academic efforts into doing as little actual work as possible. 
					    	</p>
					    	<p>
								We became suitemates again in South Campus Commons when Patrick met Hannah. I distinctly remember Hannah always saying "Patrick, I'm hungry" and borrowing my snacks when I wasn't there. 
							</p>
					    	<p>
								I'm happy to have watched them grow as a couple, and I look forward to watching them grow together as husband and wife.
